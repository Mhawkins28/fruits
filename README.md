# MEN Stack CRUD App - Adding Associations

## About 
This application will build on the [Fruits CRUD App build](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-crud-app-fruits/canvas-landing-pages/seb.html) and implement features found in the [MEN Stack Embedding Related Data](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-embedding-related-data-skyrockit/canvas-landing-pages/seb.html) canvas materials

## Features we will start with: 
1. Express boilerplate
2. Mongoose Model (Fruit)
3. Express routing for 7 Restful routes
    - new
    - create
    - index
    - show
    - delete
    - edit
    - update
4. EJS templates for new, index, show, and edit pages

## Build steps for implementing associations
1. Refactor code base to models / views / controller folder structure
1. Defining a new mongoose Schema (Image)
2. Define a create images route to make association with Fruit to new image data
3. Add new image form to show page 
3. Update show page to display image content

## Stretch goals
4. Add delete image route
5. Implement delete action to remove an Image document from a Fruit.
